# Firefly

Firefly is a research OS inspired by Plan 9. Firefly's planned name was Serenity, but [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) got there first. This project is in no way associated with SerenityOS.

The full set of code and build tools for the Firefly kernel is in [`kernel`](/kernel).
