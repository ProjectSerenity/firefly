//! ## Preemptive multitasking
//!
//! The [`thread`] module implements Firefly threads, each of which has its
//! own stack and execution state. This also includes the scheduler, which
//! can be used to switch from one thread to another, and for a thread to
//! sleep and be resumed. Combined with the Programmable Interval Timer
//! handler, this will pre-empt threads to allow fair sharing of the CPU.
