# Crypto

This set of code provides fresh implementations of cryptographic algorithms used by Firefly. These are all copied as faithfully as possible from existing implementations, using test vectors. We would prefer to use existing implementations, but RustCrypto uses too many dependencies and too much complexity for my liking.
