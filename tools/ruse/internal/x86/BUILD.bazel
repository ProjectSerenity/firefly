# This is either a dirty hack or very elegant, depending on your
# perspective. Things are much easier if we can embed the `x86`
# instruction data directly into the `x86` package as a set of
# package-level `*Instruction` variables. These are generated by
# `x86json`.
#
# However, to do so, `x86json` needs the other types and data in
# `x86`, such as the `*Parameter` values. Duplicating them into
# `x86json` would be tedious and error-prone to maintain. But we
# cannot use them directly from `x86` without creating a dependency
# loop; `x86` is used by `x86json` to generate code in `x86`.
#
# We solve this by having two versions of `x86`. First, we have
# `x86-no-data`, which is only used by `x86json` and contains the
# rest of the package. That is enough for us to generate `data.go`
# containing the `*Instruction` variables using `x86json`. We
# then embed that into a new package with the same name (`x86`),
# including `data.go`. That is then used by everyone else!
