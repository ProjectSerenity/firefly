# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Myth repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organisation's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on who owns the
# copyright.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
